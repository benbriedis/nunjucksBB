FUNCTIONALITY
> Remove or separate Express integration into separate project
> Remove or separate chokidar watch into separate project
> Would like option to insist on closed html (or whatever) tags within NJK tags
> Remove Jinja compatible mode (but see what it has to offere first)
> Ensure null and undefined are always interchangeable
> Hide JS object function calls, but first include any useful ones as filters, functions, etc
> Trawl Jinja and Twig for useful filters and functions
> MAYBE an option to disable 'include'. But NB I do like being able to dynamically construct
  include file names

CODING
> Remove weird (old?) object stuff in objects.js
> Remore asyncFor, asyncAll, asyncIf
> WebLoader - allow dynamic fetch to be disabled. Should be able to run on server for testing purposes.
> Thinks the precompile API might be broken
> Convert everything to Typescript. Enable strict mode, including noImplicityAny and strictNullChecks
> Errors and stack traces should be better
