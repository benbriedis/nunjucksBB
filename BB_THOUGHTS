FUNCTIONALITY
> Remove or separate Express integration into separate project
> Remove or separate chokidar watch into separate project
> Would like option to insist on closed html (or whatever) tags within NJK tags
> Remove Jinja compatible mode (but see what it has to offere first)
> Ensure null and undefined are always interchangeable
> Hide JS object function calls, but first include any useful ones as filters, functions, etc
> Trawl Jinja and Twig for useful filters and functions
> MAYBE an option to disable 'include'. But NB I do like being able to dynamically construct
  include file names

CODING
> Remove weird (old?) object stuff in objects.js
> Remore asyncFor, asyncAll, asyncIf
> WebLoader - allow dynamic fetch to be disabled. Should be able to run on server for testing purposes.
> Thinks the precompile API might be broken
> Convert everything to Typescript. Enable strict mode, including noImplicityAny and strictNullChecks
> Errors and stack traces should be better
> Dont like those Eslint settings. Use a code beautifer on Github commit instead?
> Is there any server code that code be omitted from the browser bundles?
> Building a 'src' directory in the root is not nice. Maybe create a 'dist' or something if this required.
  Move 'nunjucks' subdirectory contents up.
  Probably a Babel thing... may be able just to use Typescript

WORK DONE
> Removed Express app. 
  WHY? Its easy to use Nunjucks in Express without it, and this is just more fussy detail that needs to be maintained.
