[Nunjucks](https://mozilla.github.io/nunjucks/) is a full featured
templating engine for javascript. It is heavily inspired by
[jinja2](http://jinja.pocoo.org/). View the docs
[here](https://mozilla.github.io/nunjucks/).

## WARNING

This is not the main Nunjuck repository. It is a private fork which incorporates
await/async, amongst other things. This implementation is not stable, not supported, and
in places the features depart from the documentation.
